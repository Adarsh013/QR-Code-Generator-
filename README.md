# QR-Code-Generator-
Hey There !  I've developed a tool that generates QR codes for any website name entered by the user. Using the powerful "qr-image" and "inquirer" npm packages, this project not only creates a QR code but also stores the website name in a .txt file for easy reference.  Perfect for quickly accessing websites with a simple scan.
